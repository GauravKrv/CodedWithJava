    /*DEFENTITION:
    ->A stack is an ordered collection of homgenous data structures where insertion
    and deletion is done at one single end.

    OPERATIONS:
    Push, Pop, Status

    APPLICATIONS OF STACK:
    • Stack is extensively used in system programming
    Some common applications:::

1. Evaluation of arithmetic expression
• Conversion an expression to postfix notation
• Evaluation for the value
• Machine code generation

2. Execution of recursive call of a function
• Factorial calculation
• Tower of Hanoi
• Quick sort
• Merge sort

3. Scope rule implementation
• Static and dynamic scope rule management
• Activation record management

4. Memory management
• Run-time memory management

    PRECEDENCE AND AOSIATIVITY OF OPERATORS
    Precedence and associativity of operators

    – (unary), +(unary), NOT     6                  –
    ^ (exponentiation)              6           Right to left
    * (multiplication), / (division) 5          Left to right
    + (addition), – (subtraction)    4          Left to right
    <, <=, +, < >, >=               3           Left to right
    AND 2 Left to right             2           Left to Right
    OR, XOR                         1           Left to right

 e.g::A + B * C / D – E ^ F * G  ==  ((A + B) * ((C/D) – (E ^ (F * G)))) ==A B C ^ D - + E A C / – *
