/*
Consider that you have some pictures on your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer.
To transfer them, you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you
can attach a memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.

Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three-legged plug can't be connected
to a two-pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two-pronged outlets.
 Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another
